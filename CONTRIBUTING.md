Contributions are welcome.

Feel free to clone this repository, make branches, and propose pull requests when appropriate. The package is already much faster thanks to 
[this pull request](https://github.com/LivePersonInc/lplangid/pull/1)!

The github workflow in [onpush_action.yml](https://github.com/LivePersonInc/lplangid/blob/main/.github/workflows/onpush_action.yml) runs lint / format
checks using `flake` and unit tests using `pytest`. Check that file to see exactly how those commands are run.
